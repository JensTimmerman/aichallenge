See http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html for a tutorial on
how to use Alembic for migrations.


Reminder
- To upgrade the db to the latest version
  `alembic upgrade head`
- To see info about the current version
  `alembic current`
- To make a modification to the db (manually)
  `alembic revision -m "message about what changed"`
  and then edit the generated revision file
- To autogenerate a revision file based on a mismatch between the database and
  the scheme defined in battlebots.database.models
  `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message about what changed"`
  REMEMBER TO REVIEW THE REVISION! Autogenerated revision files don't detect
  everything! See http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html
  Also, if you add non-nullable columns without default value, add some values
  in the db.
- Don't mess around to much with this in development, as SQLite has very
  limited support for altering tables. You know there isn't even an "ALTER
  TABLE xxx DROP COLUMN yyy"? But we'll use MySQL on the production server
  anyway.
